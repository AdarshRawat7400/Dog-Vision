# Dog-Vision
Tools Used:- 1. TensorFlow 2.0 2. TensorFlow Hub 3. Matplotlib for data visualization  The dog vision is a deep learning multi-class dog-breed(120 breeds) classifier model[mobilenetv3] that makes use of transfer learning to make use of the weights/patterns learned by model [mobilenetv3]{over 15 million images} that it's trained on. The The Dog-vision model is trained on 10,000+ images of dogs from 120 breeds. The deep learning model has been developed in Google Colab and uses the model [MobileNetV3] available on the TensorFlow hub.
